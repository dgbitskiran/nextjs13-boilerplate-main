The test you take may include extra questions in the Reading or Listening section that do not count toward your score. These are 
either questions that enable ETS to make test scores comparable across administrations or new questions that help ETS determine 
how such questions function under actual testing conditions.
<br/><br/>
Please read the timing instructions for the Reading Section carefully. The instructions will indicate how many passages you will 
receive and the amount of time you have to respond to questions for those passages. Be sure to pace yourself so that you have 
time to answer all the questions<br/>
A standard English language (QWERTY) computer keyboard is used for the test. We recommend that you practice typing on a QWERTY 
keyboard before taking the test.
