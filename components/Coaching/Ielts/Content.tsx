an alternative test to TOEFL for admission into UK, Canadian and New Zealand universities.

All candidates have to take the same Listening and Speaking Modules. If you are planning to undertake academic study it is 
recommended that you sit for the Academic Reading and Writing Modules. If you are planning to undertake non-academic training 
or apply for immigration to Australia or New Zealand it is recommended that you sit for the General Training Reading and Writing.
